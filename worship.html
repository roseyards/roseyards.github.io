        <p>Our Service of Worship is from 12 noon to 1 pm (except in July and August when it’s from 11 am to 12 noon).</p>
        <p>As you arrive you will be welcomed at the door. Then you can sit anywhere you like, or we can show you to a seat.</p>

        <img src="/img/church_inside.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto my-4 d-block" alt="Church Interior" width="400px">

        <p>During the Service, we sing psalms and hymns, led by the choir. The hymns can be traditional or modern. The words
            are projected onto large screens at the front (however, hymnbooks and song sheets are available, if you prefer).</p>
        <p>During the Service we also pray – to praise God for who he is, to thank him for what he has done, to confess our
          own shortcomings, and to ask for help both for ourselves and for others. We also normally pray the Lord’s Prayer
          together.</p>
        <p>We also hear the word of God. Normally there are two Bible readings, one of which is read by the Minister and
          the other by a member of the congregation. Bibles (New International Version) are provided in the pews. Large
          print Bibles are available in the vestibule as you come in.</p>
        <p>Then there is a sermon in which God’s eternal word is applied to our everyday lives.</p>
        <p>The Service typically lasts about one hour.</p>
        <p>A creche is available if you have wee ones (although they’re also welcome in the Service). About half way
          through the Service, after the offering, children of primary school age can go out for Children’s Church.</p>
        <p>After the Service, everyone is welcome to go across to the hall for a cup of tea or coffee, and some
          biscuits, and a chat.</p>
        <p>We also have an Evening Service of Worship, though not every week. This is usually from 7.30 – 8.30 pm.
          Sometimes this Service is in the Church, or it may be in the more informal setting of our hall.</p>


        <h4 class="mt-0">Childrens Church</h4>
        <p>Children’s Church is for children of Primary School age, and takes place on a Sunday, during the second
          half of the Church Service (from about 12.30 – 1.00pm). Children and leaders leave for Children’s Church
          immediately after the Offering, and go across to the Minor Hall.</p>
        <p>We are mostly following the ‘The Jesus Storybook Bible’ Curriculum.</p>
        <p>To quote from the introduction:</p>

        <p><em>There are lots of stories in the Bible, but all the stories together tell one Big Story: The Story of
          how God loves his children and comes to rescue them. It takes the whole Bible to tell this Story. And at
          the centre of the story, there is a baby. Every story in the Bible whispers his name.</em></p>
        <p><em>Through memory verses, fun and engaging activities, and the stories within the award-winning Jesus
          Storybook Bible, your children will discover that Jesus loves them and that he is the Great Rescuer!</em></p>

        <p>We’re very excited about this curriculum, which takes the children through the whole Bible in about
          2 1/2 years.</p>

        <p>For more information visit www.jesusstorybookbible.com</p>

        <h4 class="mt-0">Midweek Meeting for Bible Study and Prayer</h4>
        <p>We meet together on a Wednesday from 8.00 – 9.30pm, for tea / coffee, fellowship, Bible study, and prayer.</p>
        <p>All of our Church Members and visitors too are very welcome to come along. This is an informal and friendly
          meeting which you should enjoy. More than that though, it has the potential to significantly change your
          life for the better.</p>

        <p>Hope to see you there!</p>

        <h4 class="mt-0">Pots Of Clay</h4>

        <p>‘Pots of Clay’ at Roseyards Presbyterian Church is an opportunity for people of all ages and crafting
          abilities to come together to enjoy crafting, coffee and company in a very relaxed, informal and friendly
          environment on the first Saturday of each month (D.V.).</p>
        <p>Doors are open from 10am until 12MD, though you are welcome to call at any time throughout the morning.
          Coffee is available all morning so even if you don’t feel like crafting come along and have a chat over
          a cuppa.  For those who want to dip their toe in the ‘crafting’ water, Pots of Clay offers the perfect
          opportunity.  There are demonstrations on ‘how to’ as well the opportunity to have a go.  The aim is to
          try out a wide range of craft including scrapbooking, cardmaking, jewellery making, decoupage, knitting,
          cross stitch and much more!  We also have baking demonstrations, where you have the opportunity to see
          how it’s done, taste the outcome and take home the recipe!  For readers there is a bookclub and the
          opportunity to share your passion for reading and books.</p>

        <p>We appreciate how difficult it can be for mummies, perhaps overloaded with things to do and no time to
          relax, so why don’t you make Pots of Clay ‘your’ time, where you can enjoy crafting, a chat and a peaceful
          coffee, relaxing in the knowledge that your child is being cared for and amused in our crèche?</p>

        <p>There is also the opportunity to pray if you have a particular worry or concern, you simply feel moved to
          pray for others or situations at home or across the world or you wish to give thanks.  You are welcome
          to go to the ‘Prayer Stop’ by yourself to pray or to approach one of the team who would count it a privilege
          to pray with you.  If you don’t feel you want to approach someone, you are encouraged to leave your prayer
          request in the prayer box and the team will include it when they meet to pray.</p>

        <p>‘Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present
          your requests to God.  And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts
          and your minds in Christ Jesus’. (Philippians 4 v 6,7 NIV).</p>

        <p>Admission charge for Pots of Clay is £2, which includes tea/coffee.  More importantly we want you to be
          there and to bring a friend!</p>

        <p>Our Sunday Club is for children in P1 and above.</p>
        <p>Through stories, songs, memory verses, drama and crafts, the children learn about Jesus.</p>
        <p>We meet in the Church Hall on a Sunday from 11 – 11.45 am.</p>
        <h4 class="mt-0">Book Club</h4>

        <p>If there’s one thing better than reading a good book, it’s being able to talk about it afterwards with
          people who want to listen. That’s one benefit of a book club. Another is that we get to read books we
          mightn’t have thought of ourselves.</p>

        <p>Roseyards Book Club started in 2011, as part of the larger Pots of Clay event. We meet in the
          Roseyards Church Hall from 10.15 – 11.00 (or 11.15) on the first Saturday of the month from October
          to May (8 months in all).</p>

        <p>Tea and coffee are served beforehand, and afterwards there is opportunity to join in with other
          ‘Pots of Clay’ activities if desired.</p>

        <p>New members are always very welcome at any time. We’re a friendly and relaxed group. If you would
          like to join us, there is only one qualification required – that you enjoy a good read. So please do
          come along and try us out!</p>

        <p>In case you need more convincing, here’s what one of our members has to say:</p>

        <p><em>Three words to describe Roseyards Book Club – friendly, fun and thought-provoking!</em></p>

        <p><em>We have travelled the world in our books, from London to Australia, from Afghanistan to Africa, giving us insight into unknown worlds.</em></p>

        <p><em>Our discussions are friendly and relaxed with plenty of humour.</em></p>

        <p><em>I have certainly read books I would never have chosen otherwise, and am so glad I did, and I look forward to our next amazing book journey!</em></p>
